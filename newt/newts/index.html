	<h1>All about newts</h1>

	<p1>Newts are amhibians from the Order Caudata. A newt is a type of salamnder. All newts are salamanders, but not all salamanders are newts. Newts are usually aquatic, but if they live on land, they must stay in moist environments, and all newts return to the water to breed and lay eggs. </p1>

	<p1>California has one native newt, commonly called the California Newt Tarica torosa. My favorite species of newt lives in Eastern US called the Eastern Newt, or Red Spotted Newt Notophthalmus viridescens. </p1>
